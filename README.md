# SYPad-Editor
SYpad Editor is basically a text editing software more like a Notepad but it is an advanced version of that. I started this project 2 weeks ago, the whole project is created by myself. This SYpad Editor is fully made in Python Programming Language with the help of Tkinter module. The IDE which is used for making this project is Spyder V4.1.4.
